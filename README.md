## 🧩 Projects — SOC Level 1 Capstone Challenges

### 🔹 Tempest  
Investigate a compromised workstation impacted by a full attack chain and reconstruct the attacker’s actions.

### 🔹 Boogeyman 1  
A new threat actor calling themselves **Boogeyman** has appeared. Analyze provided artifacts and determine the scope of compromise.

### 🔹 Boogeyman 2  
The Boogeyman returns with new techniques and indicators. Identify persistence, lateral movement, and any new IoCs.

### 🔹 Boogeyman 3  
The threat actor resurfaces once again. Perform deep-dive threat hunting and correlation across multiple data sources.

### 🔹 Hidden Hooks — SOC Simulator Scenario  
Investigate suspicious activity targeting **TryHatMe Studios**. Analyze logs, artifacts, and intelligence to uncover hidden attacker footholds.

### 🔹 Open Door — SOC Simulator Scenario  
Threat intelligence reports leaked credentials tied to your organization. Investigate authentication logs and identify unauthorized access paths.
